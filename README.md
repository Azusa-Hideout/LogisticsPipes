Logistics Pipes is an extensive overhaul of the Buildcraft pipe system. It allows for better distribution of items via pipes, more organised stockkeeping and easier automated crafting.

Please check out the original mod [CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/logistics-pipes) for more information.

This repo is not maintain by same author, please refrain from report issue to them. If the issue comes from the original mod, I ~~and other~~ will try cooperative and fix it if possible.
